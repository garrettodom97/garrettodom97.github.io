											<h2>Engineer --> Dev</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I'm a former aerospace engineer who loves coding so much that I quit my job to pursue a career in software development. I received an education in full stack web development through the Actualize Coding Bootcamp, and have been a full-stack engineer working with numeroues technologies for a variety of clients and projects since.</p>

											<h2>Band Website</h2>

										<h2>Visit Author of Your Downfall's official website <a src="www.authorofyourdownfall.com">here</a>.</h2>
										<p>I recently built a website for the band I play in. The site is built using React, and makes use of several React libraries found on npm to do things like embed YouTube and Spotify links, give a cool typewriter effect to fit the narrative of the band and our latest EP, and display social media icons that double as links to all of our socials. I built the site from the ground up as a fully solo project.</p>

											<h2>Full Stack Engineer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>As a Full Stack Engineer at Postlight, a software consulting company, I had the opportunity to rapidly build on the skills I acquired through my coding bootcamp. I worked on multiple different teams and projects, and tocuhed a wide variety of tech stacks. From Elixir and Phoenix LiveView to React to even prototyping a Twitch extension, I've learned so much about web development and how to build and maintain complex web applications.</p>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/flight_support.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Aircraft Support</h3>
										<p>I had the opportunity to be on the flight support team for a demonstator aircaft during it's flight test porgram. This involved interfacing directly with the flight computers to verify configuration and performing a pre-flight test.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/matlab.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>MatLab</h3>
										<p>I used custom made MatLab scripts often to analyze data and display it for techincal leads. I also had to be able to trace and troubleshoot the Simulink controls models.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/metronome_app.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Metronome App</h3>
										<p>I was tasked with building a fully functioning iOS app for pilots to be able to perform frequency sweeps on the aircraft. I was able to build a functioning app that was used during flight in just under three weeks having never used xCode or Swift.</p>

								<p class="content">During my senior year at UT, I completed a two semester design project that involved building a fixed wing aircraft to perform an autonomous search and deploy mission. We bought a kit aircraft, but had to completely build our own wings as well as modify it to hold multiple sensors and a flight computer. I was personally repsonsible for the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), meaning I defined the speeds and heights that the aircraft would fly at during different parts of the mission. I also mapped out flight data in MatLab in order to determine the best search pattern for the aircraft to fly.</p>

										<p>While at UT, I played ultimate frisbee for our college team, and we competed at the National Championships two years in a row. I also love to play video games and pretty much anything else nerdy!</p>
